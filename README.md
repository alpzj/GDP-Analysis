# GDP-Analysis

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measure of the size and health of an economy. It represents the total value of all goods and services produced within a country over a specific period of time, usually a year. GDP is considered a key indicator of a country's economic performance and is used to compare the economic output of different countries.

There are several ways to analyze GDP data. One way is to compare GDP growth over time to get a sense of how an economy is expanding or contracting. Another way is to compare GDP per capita, which is GDP divided by the population of a country, to get a sense of the average standard of living in a country.
